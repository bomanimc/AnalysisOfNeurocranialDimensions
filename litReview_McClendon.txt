3. Generate hypotheses & review literature State the hypotheses you want to
test and include a brief literature review. Discuss appropriate types of tests. Due
date: before first class of Week 6, 3 points.

Hypothesis: The behavioral plasticity – based on neurocranial capacity – of mammals living in urban areas will be greater than those living in rural areas.

Types of Analysis:
One important thing for this project is normalizing the data with respect to body sizes. Animals with larger bodies will probably have larger neurocranial capacity, so I'll need to make sure to scale with respect to that.

After normalizing, I think that plotting the relationships between multiple variables would be helpful. If I see any strong relations, I can try out making a regression model that might fit the relationship well.
